This project was completed as the final competition for Northwesternâ€™s Data Science course. The challenge was to predict the nightly price of Airbnb listings across Chicago, Asheville, and Kauai Island using a dataset with 57 variables.

My model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of $93/night, ranking 11th out of 124 students (top 9%) on the competition leaderboard.
